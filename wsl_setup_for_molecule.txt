WSL is not VLAN capable

Windows needs virtual network adapter setup to allow tagged and untagged traffic at the same time
enabled through hyper-V features

In Powershell:
Get-NetAdapter
New-VMSwitch -name VLAN-vSwitch -NetAdapterName Ethernet -AllowManagementOS $true

Remove-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -Name VLAN-vSwitch

# create as many tagged switches as needed:
Add-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -Name "VLAN123" -SwitchName "VLAN-vSwitch" -Passthru | Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -Access -VlanId 123
Get-NetAdapter

Install Virtual Box on Windows
Install vagrant in WSL
Install vagrant plugin install virtualbox_WSL2

on first vagrant up firewall rule pop-up enable both, public and private networks
-> WSL counts as public network

Vagrant should now have full access
