```

The variables are split up into three files according to their content (`common.yml`, `extensions.yml`, `themes.yml`).
The same goes for tasks and they are addtionally prefixed with `present` or `absent` depending on them beeing intended to setup a certain feature or remove it.
As you can see currently the absent implementation only exist in one single file since it's feasable for my curernt usecase.
The tasks related to extensions and tehemes are split up into handelers and the actual setup tasks.
The handlers are meant to take care o preparation steps and check if the extensions/themes are already present or not.
In case not they loop over the tasks to setup and run their install routine implemented in (`present_extension` and `present_themes`)
