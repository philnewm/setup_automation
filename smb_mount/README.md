SMB mount setup based on systemd mount files
--------------------------------------------

This creates the required systemd mount files to mount smb shares on boot.
The role only creates a single smb user based on the provided secrets.yml file.
This role has a state variable called `smb_mount_state`. It controlls if the features of this role should be setup or removed.

Testing
-------

This role includes a full vagrant based molecule testing setup for CentOSStream9, Almalinux9, Rocky9, Debian12 and Ubuntu22.10 VMs at `smb_mount/molecule`. Each scenario uses the the `smb_server` role to enable testable mounts. Additionally the scenarios use symlinks for their `requirements.yml` and the roles directory. The `molecule.yml` file on the other hand is individual for each scenario.

The file `/molecule/template/converge.yml` as supposed to be used as playbook template. The tasks are split into `present.yml`, `absent.yml` - which both get included in the `main.yml`. Any external dependencies are included in dependencies.yml, which is supposed to run in a pre_task.

Requirements
------------

This role requires the `cifs` package to be installed.
This is handled inside the `tasks/dependcies.yml` file and should get executed in the pre_tasks section of a playbook.

This example shows the necessary file for the smb user credentials (secrets.yml)

```yaml
- name: Converge smb mount present
  hosts: client

  vars_files:
    - smb_vars.yml

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Include dependencies
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: smb_mount
        tasks_from: dependencies.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Include smb role present
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: smb_mount
        tasks_from: main.yml
      vars:
        smb_mount_state: present
